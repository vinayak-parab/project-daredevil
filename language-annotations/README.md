This subdir contains sound annotations..

These are annotated by listening to the first ~5 seconds in each video of soccernet.

If no words are spoken by commentators, video was skipped ahead.

The annotator is Norwegian, with limited language knowledge, which likely results in inaccurate annotations for languages other than 'English'


# Note
# Lanuage annotations can be loaded and used in 2 main ways based on preference and setup
# 1) run 'generate_language_annotations.py --root_dir <ROOT_DIR of soccernet dataset> --annotations </annotations/..>
